Hello!

Here are some simple instructions for my encryptor and testing the files included.

If you run 'make' the program using the given makefile or the compile command you 
can pipe the files named 'appleEncrypted.jpg' and 'diceEncrypted.jpg' while using the 
keyfile provided and redirecting output to a any .jpg file. You will see the end result
of 'appleEncrypted.jpg' and 'diceEncrypted.jpg' being the same as their respective 'orignal'

Please feel free to test this with any file as the keyfile, just ensure you use the 
same key to DECRYPT that was used to ENCRYPT.

THANK YOU,
